Things I know nothing about: 
- I have never worked for a talent agency. 
- When working for a talent agency, you do have access to the internal job postings boards.
- The talent agency will get your security clearance for you and any language tests needed, which helps with future job applications. 

# Terms and Lingo

- English Essential, French Essential - you only need to know one language to get this job. 
- Bilingual Imperative - you must pass a test to prove you are bilingual enough for this job.
- Indeterminate - Full time, benefits, part of the union. 
- Term - You are working for the government on a contract and are not part of the union. 
- If you are Term, and get an Indeterminate posting, you can usually buy back your pension so the time you spent as term counts towards your retirement. 
- Acting, Assignment, Secondment, Deployment - only for internal job postings. They mean "come work for my team for 6 mnths, at the same pay you always get."

# Timelines

From a director's perspective, hiring someone from outside the government to become an Indeterminate employee is a two year process. 

During those years, budgets change, management changes, departments are restructured, and most indeterminate job postings simply vanish without ever hiring anyone. 

From an employee perspective, it's about 1-1.5 years from submitting the resume to signing the Letter of Offer (LOO). 

Nothing is official until you have a LOO in hand. The manager/director who wants to hire you will tell you the job is a sure thing, but until you sign that LOO, it isn't. 

No one will know your start date until the LOO has been created by HR. Neither you nor your manager will know the start date until you have a LOO.
